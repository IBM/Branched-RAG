## Branched RAG: Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation

### 1. Introduction
Branched RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an enhancement of the standard RAG approach, designed to improve information retrieval and response generation in complex knowledge domains. This document outlines the key features, benefits, and applications of Branched RAG.

### 2. Key Differences from Simple RAG
Branched RAG introduces several improvements over simple RAG:

1. **Multiple Retrieval Steps**: Performs sequential retrievals instead of a single step.
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Utilizes a branching pattern where each retrieval informs subsequent retrievals.
3. **Specialized Knowledge Bases**: Different branches can query separate, specialized knowledge bases.
4. **Dynamic Query Refinement**: Refines queries based on intermediate results for more focused retrievals.

### 3. Branched RAG Procedure

#### 3.1 Initial Broad Retrieval
- Casts a wide net to capture potentially relevant information
- Provides context for subsequent, more focused retrievals

#### 3.2 Intermediate Retrievals
- Narrows down the search space based on initial results
- Allows exploration of specific sub-topics or related areas

#### 3.3 Final Focused Retrieval
- Yields highly relevant information for the given query
- Improves the precision of the retrieved content

#### 3.4 Generation Step
- Synthesizes information from multiple retrieval steps
- Produces a more comprehensive and accurate response
